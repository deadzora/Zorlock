# ZORLOCK

![Zorlock](/Resources/Branding/cropped-Head.png?raw=true "Zorlock")

Zorlock is primarily an early-stage interactive application and rendering engine for Windows. Currently not much is implemented. 

## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2019 is recommended, Zorlock is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/deadzora/Zorlock.git`

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!

## The Plan
The plan for Zorlock is two-fold: to create a powerful 3D engine that supports OpenGL, DirectX and Vulkan. There is a much more advanced version of the engine in a branch repository called `dev`, accessible to supporters and developers. 

### Main features to come:
- Fast 2D rendering (UI, particles, sprites, etc.)
- High-fidelity Physically-Based 3D rendering (this will be expanded later, 2D to come first)
- Support for Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Playstation and Xbox
    - Native rendering API support (DirectX, Vulkan, Metal)
- Fully featured viewer and editor applications
- Fully scripted interaction and behavior
- Integrated 3rd party 2D and 3D physics engine
- Procedural terrain and world generation
- Artificial Intelligence
- Audio system
